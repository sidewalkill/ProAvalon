Go into:

https://github.com/vck3000/ProAvalon/blob/master/routes/forum.js

Here's where you'll find deletion, which Pro does through 3 convoluted if statements.
413 to 454 is like deleting posts for mods?
Put a "notify" after these lines:
419 - posts
431 - comments
444 - replies

Statements like 

comment.oldText = comment.text;

call the DB

You can get the comment by calling this string, to put in the notify.

Check how he does notify for warnings, bans, and avatar requests.
