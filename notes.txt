Go into:

https://github.com/vck3000/ProAvalon/blob/master/routes/forum.js

Here's where you'll find deletion, which Pro does through 3 convoluted if statements.
413 to 454 is like deleting posts for mods?
Put a "notify" after these lines:
419 - posts
431 - comments
444 - replies

Statements like 

comment.oldText = comment.text;

call the DB

You can get the comment by calling this string, to put in the notify.

Check how he does notify for warnings, bans, and avatar requests.

Makes a mongoose DB model in: https://github.com/sidewalkill/ProAvalon/tree/master/models

Copy the format for the ip ban or avatar request one, probably something like:

var mongoose = require("mongoose");

//SCHEMA SETUP
var forumDeletionSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
	type: String, //post, comment, reply?
  
	modWhoBanned: {
		id: {
			type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
			ref: "User"
		},
		username: String
	},

	whenDeleted: Date,

	usernamesAssociated: [String]
});

//compile schema into a model
var forumDeletion = mongoose.model("ForumDeletion", forumDeletionSchema);

module.exports = forumDeletionSchema;
